The Library Patron Management System (LMS) is a console-based Java application designed to help librarians efficiently manage library patron records. This system allows users to add, remove, and display patrons, either manually through a command-line interface (CLI) or by importing data from a text file. Each patron has a unique 7-digit ID, a name, an address, and a current overdue fine amount.

The application ensures accurate record-keeping, easy data management, and quick operations for library staff. All patron data is stored in memory, providing a lightweight solution without requiring external databases.

Key Features:

Add patrons manually through the CLI.

Import multiple patrons from a formatted text file.

Remove patrons using their unique ID.

Display all current patrons in the system.

Simple, user-friendly menu interface for library staff.
